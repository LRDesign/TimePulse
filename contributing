We are actively interested in seeing outside contribution to TimePulse. It
suits our needs, but that's not the same thing as suiting everyone's. With that
in mind, we want to be up front about the sort of things we'd like to see in
contributions.

* Use the normal [github pull-request
  flow](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). We'd prefer that
  you make a fork and submit PR's based on local branches.
* Do your best to adhere to the existing coding conventions and idioms. For the
  most part, we're trying to move to a model where both models and controllers
  are lightweight, and application logic lives in support classes. The current
  code certainly isn't exemplary at this, though, so don't sweat it too much.
* Don't use hard tabs, and don't leave trailing whitespace on any line. Before
  committing, run git diff --check to  make sure of this.
* Add to the Gemfile only sparingly - be prepared to defend your additions,
  especially if a related gem is already in the project.
* Do feel free to add yourself to the Contributors list in the the README.
  Alphabetical order applies.
* Add specs for the features you're adding. PR's that break the existing specs,
  or reduce coverage won't be merged.
* Do note that in order for us to merge any non-trivial changes (as a rule of
  thumb, additions larger than about 15 lines of code), we need an explicit
  assignment of copyright license from you. Copy the template in
  license-assignments/ in your first pull request and update it with your
  information.
